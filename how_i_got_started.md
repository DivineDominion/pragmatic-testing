# How I got started

Within the entire development team at Artsy the iOS team was unique in that it didn't write tests. This is in part due to the issues around tooling, horror stories about lost productivity and a lack of non-trivial examples. The other part was that no-one else was doing it when they were a small team. You would hear about large companies with tens of employees creating a large testing structure, but very few small startups with a couple of programmers were talking about testing.

We had experimented once or twice with adding testing to our applications but without team consensus the attempts fell flat.

We're a pretty old community, objective-c was in it's mid 20s by the time Swift was announced.
