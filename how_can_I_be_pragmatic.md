# How can I be pragmatic with my testing?

The term pragmatic here comes from the book, [the Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer). It describes five main aspects of being a pragmatic programmer:

* Early adopter / fast adapter
* Inquisitive
* Critical thinker
* Realistic
* Jack-of-all-trades

We want to take a similar approach, your testing should cover a large array of interactions on your application but the aim is not 100% code coverage, and the aim is to also say no to different techniques. We want the test base to be fast, and the results to be stable. A test that occasionally passes and occasionally fails can be extremely detrimental to the belief that maintaining tests is worth your time.

There are many options in terms of strategies and tactics for writing tests. Many of which we'll be talking about in the upcoming chapters but we'll be focusing specifically on the tooling that I've found the most value in. This does not necessarily mean that there is little value in the topics left out, but that as a part of growing our test-base I've used those enough to warrent it's long-term usage in my applications.
