# How I got started

Within the entire development team at Artsy, the iOS team was unique in that it didn't write tests. This is in part due to the issues around tooling, horror stories about lost productivity and a lack of non-trivial examples. The other part was that no-one else was doing it when they were a small team. You would hear about large companies with tens of employees creating a large testing structure, but very few small startups with a couple of programmers were talking about testing.

We had experimented once or twice with adding testing to our applications but without team consensus the attempts fell flat.

At the end of 2013 the [Bus Factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) for all of the knowledge in the Artsy mobile apps was through the roof. I was the only one with any knowledge of how our systems worked, what additional context anyone needed to make a change and it was not expressed in any other format.

Laura Brown and dB joined the mobile team to help raise our testing standards, helping create a healthy culture around testing our changes and externalising our expectations on what the code does into tests.
