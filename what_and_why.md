## What is this book?

This is a book that aims to be a down to earth guide to testing iOS applications. It came out of a long period of writing tests to multiple existing non-trivial Apps whilst working at [Artsy](http://artsy.net).

I found very few consolidated resources for testing in general, they are documented in the recommodations section.

## Who is it for?

Anyone interested in applying tests to iOS applications. Which hopefully should be a large amount of people.
