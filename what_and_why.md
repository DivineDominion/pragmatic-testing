## What is this book?

This is a book that aims to be a down to earth guide to testing iOS applications. It came out of a long period of writing tests to multiple non-trivial Apps whilst working at [Artsy](http://artsy.net).

I found very few consolidated resources for testing in iOS general. A lot of the best book advice revolved around reading books about Java and C# and applying the techniques to Objective-C projects. Like any creative output this book does not live in a vacuum, the books I used to get to this point are in the recommendations section.

Finally this is not a generic iOS Testing book. I will not be objective. This is a pragmatic book from a pragmatic programmer known for making things, not architecting things. There will be things you disagree with, and I'm of the _strong opinions, weakly held_ camp but this is drawn from real-world experience.

## About the author

Orta Therox is a programmer at Artsy, and gave himself the title Design Dictator at the open source project CocoaPods. His interest in testing piqued when the Artsy mobile team shrank to just him and he realized that he's going to get the blame for everything from that point forward.

## Who is it for?

Anyone interested in applying tests to iOS applications. Which hopefully should be a large amount of people.
