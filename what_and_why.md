## What is this book?

This is a book that aims to be a down to earth guide to testing iOS applications. It came out of a long period of writing tests to multiple non-trivial Apps whilst working at [Artsy](http://artsy.net).

I found very few consolidated resources for testing in iOS general. A lot of the best book advice revolved around reading books about Java and C#, which this book does not try to replace but to enhance the experiences of. If there's new terms in here for you I have been hyperlinking the first instance with what I consider to be a great resource for learning more on the subject.

Finally this is not a generic iOS Testing book. I will not be objective. This is a pragmatic book from a pragmatic programmer known for making things, not architecting things. There will be things you disagree with, and I'm of the _strong opinions, weakly held_ camp but this is drawn from real-world experience.

## About the author

## Who is it for?

Anyone interested in applying tests to iOS applications. Which hopefully should be a large amount of people.
